#Inspiration

I decided to code a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic functions because I often found myself in need of a quick and efficient tool for everyday calculations like adding up expenses or converting units. Moreover, building this calculator provided an excellent opportunity to practice my programming skills and delve into the logic behind algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was a fulfilling project that not only satisfied my curiosity but also left me with a useful and handy tool to share with friends and family.

#Challenges 

In the development of this simple calculator code, I encountered a crucial challenge - how to handle division by zero. To ensure the calculator's reliability, I implemented a conditional check that examines the user's input and displays an informative error message when attempting to divide a number by zero. This safeguard prevents potential program crashes and provides a user-friendly experience by guiding users away from invalid inputs.

Throughout the project, I aimed to strike a balance between usability and robustness. I made sure the calculator performs efficiently while gracefully handling edge cases, such as division by zero. This first piece of the intermediate project exemplifies the careful consideration and problem-solving skills required to create a user-friendly and dependable tool for basic arithmetic operations. As I progress with the project, I look forward to exploring more advanced features and refining the calculator's functionality to meet user needs effectively. Stay tuned for further updates on this exciting coding journey!
